# Ether.Network

Ether.Network is being rewrited and renamed into [Sylver](https://github.com/Eastrall/Sylver).
It is far more than a simple rewrite and project renaming. 

In fact, a lot of things were missing in Ether.Network like real documentation and guides that describe how to setup a TCP server for instance; because at the begining, the project was a POC (proof of concept) for one of my personal projects. It is one of my first open-source project with contributors and I am very happy of the results we had together.

With [Sylver], I intend to change this process and develop features and make the documentation and guides at the same time, so people can integrate the [Sylver] library in their projects.
All of the issues, suggestions, pull requests in progress will be added to [Sylver].

**Thank you** to all contributors that made PRs, openned issues and made suggestions. I hope to see you contributing to [Sylver] in the near future.


*This project is now archived. You can still find the code in the `ether-network-old` branch.*
