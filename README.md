# Ether.Network

Ether.Network is being rewrited and renamed into [Sylver](https://github.com/Eastrall/Sylver).
It is far more than a simple rewrite and project renaming. 

In fact, a lot of things were missing in Ether.Network like real documentation and guides that describe how to setup a TCP server for instance; because at the begining, the project was a POC (proof of concept) for one of my personal projects. It is one of my first open-source project with contributors and I am very happy of the results we had together.



All of the issues, suggestions, pull requests in progress will be added to [Sylver]
